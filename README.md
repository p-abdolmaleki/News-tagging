# News tagging

- In this repository, we intend to tag the news based on the headline and description of the news in four classes.
- We have built 6 models and tested each of them, and in the end, model-1, which is also a convolutional model, is more accurate. (It even performs better than the transformer and bidirectional models that we have taught).
- We have trained our model on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parsaabdolmaleki/news-dataset/data).
- How to preprocess raw news and use models is given in the main folder.
